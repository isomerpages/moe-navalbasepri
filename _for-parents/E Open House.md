**Caring Educators**
<br> At NBPS, our staff are passionate in nurturing each Navalite’s love for learning. Innovative teaching strategies and continued Professional Development are championed by our Teacher Leader Council and they guide our dedicated team of teachers in reflecting and designing appropriate learning interventions to suit the needs of our Navalites. Every teacher plays the role of a caring and nurturing educator, and a structured framework allows teachers to build a strong rapport with each individual Navalite under their care. <br>

**Supportive Partners**
<br><u>Every Parent a Supportive Partner</u><br> Robust collaboration between parents and teachers ensures that every Navalite is well supported in their holistic learning and development at NBPS. Some key outreach platforms to parents include the Parent-Teacher-Student Conference, Positive Parenting Programme seminars and subject-specific parent workshops (E.g. Parent Workshops for Mathematics and Science).

#### <u>Frequently Asked Question (FAQ)</u>
![](/images/E%20OPEN%20HOUSE/frequently%20asked%20question.png)

##### <u>Primary 1 Registration</u>

<b>1.  When and how can I register my child for Primary 1?</b>
    
The registration for Singapore Citizen and Permanent Resident children will tentatively take place from end June to August 2023. Please visit the [MOE Primary 1 Registration Website](https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration) for the latest updates and&nbsp; announcements. You may also join the mailing list to receive an email alert when registration information updates are available.

<b>2.  Will my child have priority during the P1 Registration Exercise if he/she is enrolled in NBPS MOE Kindergarten?</b>

Yes, students enrolled in NBPS MK will be eligible to register during Phase 2A(2). Please visit the [MOE Primary 1 Registration Website](https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration/registration-phases-key-dates?pt=2A(2)) for more details.&nbsp;

<b>3.  Will Non-Singaporean/PR siblings of current NBPS students be given priority during the P1 Registration Exercise?</b>

All International students (IS) can only register for Primary 1 during Phase 3 of the P1 Registration Exercise. Please visit the [MOE Primary 1 Registration Website](https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration/international-students) for more details.

##### <u>Special Needs and Learning Support</u>

<b>1.  How will the students with special needs be supported in NBPS?</b>

Support for students with special needs are determined based on their needs, following the MOE guideline using a tiered support system.&nbsp;

Students with mild conditions will fall under Tier 1, with support provided mainly by their teachers. Students who require more support in their learning may receive intervention in the form of small group remediation through specialised programmes like Learning Support Programme (LSP), Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM), School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR), Reading Remediation Programme (RRP), Improve Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN) to help them with basic Math and Reading skills.&nbsp;

For students with social skills and behaviour concerns, our Special Educational Needs (SEN) officers will conduct pull out sessions with them. For students with higher needs, they will be supported by a SEN officer in class or for pull out sessions and severe cases may be referred to external agencies (eg. Reach, MOE EP, AWWA etc) for professional help.

<b>2.  For students already diagnosed with a special need condition, will there be any assessment done when they enter Primary 1? For those who are not diagnosed, how will they be identified?</b>

A survey form will be given to parents during Primary 1 registration. Parents are highly encouraged to indicate their child’s condition in the form if your child has been diagnosed or has gone through therapy programmes in pre-school (eg. DS-LC, DS-Plus, EIPIC). Our SEN officers will then contact parents to find out more about their child's needs and how to support them in school. If students present with severe learning difficulties, the school may conduct simple screening assessments to determine the child’s performance levels. If problems persist, the school can provide parents with a referral to seek professional help.&nbsp;

<b>3.  My child was previously from Rainbow Centre and is strongly encouraged to join a normal spectrum school. How can we ensure a smooth transition from kindergarten to Primary 1 for my child?</b>

For transition support to Primary 1, the SEN officers may meet up with parents to gather more information about the child’s needs. Arrangements can be made for the child to visit the school beforehand, or even for Rainbow Centre teachers to meet up with NBPS teachers if needed. It would be good for parents to provide the school with any feedback from the Rainbow Centre teachers as well as a copy of the psychological report and psychologist recommendation for his school placement.

##### <u>General</u>

<b>1.  How do I enrol my child in NBPS’s Student Care?</b>

Registration for student care will take place after the P1 Registration Exercise. More details will be provided during P1 Orientation.

<b>2.  What is the reporting and dismissal time at NBPS?</b>

Students are to report to school by 7:30am and dismissal time will be at 1.30pm for all levels.&nbsp;

<b>3.  Does NBPS offer Tamil Language?</b>&nbsp;

Yes, Tamil Language is offered as a Mother Tongue in NBPS.&nbsp;

<b>4.  Are students required to audition for CCA?</b>

Students are only required to join a CCA from Primary 3. No auditions or trials are needed. However, parents may provide additional information regarding their child’s interests, skills or prior experience during the CCA Registration at the end of Primary 2. This information will be taken into consideration during the CCA allocation.&nbsp;

<b>5.  How can I communicate with my child’s teachers?</b>

Parents may email the teacher directly using the email addresses found on the school website. Alternatively, parents may also contact the school by calling 67537114 or by writing a note in your child’s Navalite Compass (Student handbook). Individual teachers may also use other modes of communication (for example, Google Chat).
