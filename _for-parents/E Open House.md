<p><strong>Caring Educators</strong>
<br>At NBPS, our staff are passionate in nurturing each Navaliteâ€™s love for
learning. Innovative teaching strategies and continued Professional Development
are championed by our Teacher Leader Council and they guide our dedicated
team of teachers in reflecting and designing appropriate learning interventions
to suit the needs of our Navalites. Every teacher plays the role of a caring
and nurturing educator, and a structured framework allows teachers to build
a strong rapport with each individual Navalite under their care.

<p><strong>Inviting Learning Spaces</strong>
<br>A positive environment is instrumental in enriching Navalitesâ€™ learning
and physical well-being. Having undergone the PERI Upgrading Project since
2018, Navalites now enjoy new and upgraded facilities where they can create,
explore and most importantly, embark on the joy of learning. These include
the Make-a-Splash room, Knowledge Hub, school garden, Indoor Sports Hall,
Dance studio and Band Room.

<h5><u>Primary 1 Registration</u></h5>
<p><strong>1. When and how can I register my child for Primary 1?</strong>
</p>
<p>The registration for Singapore Citizen and Permanent Resident children
will tentatively take place from end June to August each year. Please visit
the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOE Primary 1 Registration Website</a> for
the latest updates and&nbsp; announcements. You may also join the mailing
list to receive an email alert when registration information updates are
available.</p>
<p><strong>2. Will my child have priority during the P1 Registration Exercise if he/she is enrolled in NBPS MOE Kindergarten?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, students enrolled in NBPS MK will be eligible to register during
Phase 2A(2). Please visit the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration/registration-phases-key-dates?pt=2A(2)" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOE Primary 1 Registration Website</a> for
more details.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Will Non-Singaporean/PR siblings of current NBPS students be given priority during the P1 Registration Exercise?</strong>
</p>
<p>All International students (IS) can only register for Primary 1 during
Phase 3 of the P1 Registration Exercise. Please visit the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration/international-students" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOE Primary 1 Registration Website</a> for
more details.</p>
<h5><u>Special Needs and Learning Support</u></h5>
<p><strong>1. How will the students with special needs be supported in NBPS?</strong>
</p>
<p>Support for students with special needs are determined based on their
needs, following the MOE guideline using a tiered support system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students with mild conditions will fall under Tier 1, with support provided
mainly by their teachers. Students who require more support in their learning
may receive intervention in the form of small group remediation through
specialised programmes like Learning Support Programme (LSP), Learning
Support for Mathematics (LSM), School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR),
Reading Remediation Programme (RRP), Improve Confidence and Achievement
in Numeracy (ICAN) to help them with basic Math and Reading skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For students with social skills and behaviour concerns, our Special Educational
Needs (SEN) officers will conduct pull out sessions with them. For students
with higher needs, they will be supported by a SEN officer in class or
for pull out sessions and severe cases may be referred to external agencies
(eg. Reach, MOE EP, AWWA etc) for professional help.</p>
<p><strong>2. For students already diagnosed with a special need condition, will there be any assessment done when they enter Primary 1? For those who are not diagnosed, how will they be identified?</strong>
</p>
<p>A survey form will be given to parents during Primary 1 registration.
Parents are highly encouraged to indicate their childâ€™s condition in the
form if your child has been diagnosed or has gone through therapy programmes
in pre-school (eg. DS-LC, DS-Plus, EIPIC). Our SEN officers will then contact
parents to find out more about their child's needs and how to support them
in school. If students present with severe learning difficulties, the school
may conduct simple screening assessments to determine the childâ€™s performance
levels. If problems persist, the school can provide parents with a referral
to seek professional help.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. My child was previously from Rainbow Centre and is strongly encouraged to join a normal spectrum school. How can we ensure a smooth transition from kindergarten to Primary 1 for my child?</strong>
</p>
<p>For transition support to Primary 1, the SEN officers may meet up with
parents to gather more information about the childâ€™s needs. Arrangements
can be made for the child to visit the school beforehand, or even for Rainbow
Centre teachers to meet up with NBPS teachers if needed. It would be good
for parents to provide the school with any feedback from the Rainbow Centre
teachers as well as a copy of the psychological report and psychologist
recommendation for his school placement.</p>
<h5><u>General</u></h5>
<p><strong>1. How do I enrol my child in NBPSâ€™s Student Care?</strong>
</p>
<p>Registration for student care will take place after the P1 Registration
Exercise. More details will be provided during P1 Orientation.</p>
<p><strong>2. What is the reporting and dismissal time at NBPS?</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are to report to school by 7:30am and dismissal time will be
at 1.30pm for all levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Does NBPS offer Tamil Language?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, Tamil Language is offered as a Mother Tongue in NBPS.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Are students required to audition for CCA?</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are only required to join a CCA from Primary 3. No auditions
or trials are needed. However, parents may provide additional information
regarding their childâ€™s interests, skills or prior experience during the
CCA Registration at the end of Primary 2. This information will be taken
into consideration during the CCA allocation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. How can I communicate with my childâ€™s teachers?</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents may email the teacher directly using the email addresses found
on the school website. Alternatively, parents may also contact the school
by calling 67537114 or by writing a note in your childâ€™s Navalite Compass
(Student handbook). Individual teachers may also use other modes of communication
(for example, Google Chat).</p>
