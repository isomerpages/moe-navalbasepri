## PARENT SUPPORT GROUP 


NBPS Parent Support Group, officially started with the formation of its first Executive Committee in 2018 and through this structure, it is able to support the school in bigger ways. Through the platform of PSG, the parents are provided with ample opportunities to be closer to their children, to understand them better and help them in their journey of learning in their foundational years. This partnership has benefited their children through their involvement in various school activities.
