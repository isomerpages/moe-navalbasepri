<h2>PARENT SUPPORT GROUP&nbsp;</h2>
<p>NBPS Parent Support Group, officially started with the formation of its
first Executive Committee in 2018 and through this structure, it is able
to support the school in bigger ways. Through the platform of PSG, the
parents are provided with ample opportunities to be closer to their children,
to understand them better and help them in their journey of learning in
their foundational years. This partnership has benefited their children
through their involvement in various school activities.</p>
