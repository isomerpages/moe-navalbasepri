##### Commit Learning School House Profile Description

Committing to a better tomorrow and excel beyond expectations. Commit Learning SchoolHouse (CLS) is committed to design an interactive, participative and technologically enabled learning Student Care Centre (SCC) holistic experience to help every child to develop into broadly educated indiviudals, with depth of knowledge and capabilities required to thrive in the 21st century which complements every child’s primary school education.

Commit Learning SchoolHouse SCC programmes are aligned closely to the MOE guidelines. Our curriculum has been thoughtfully designed with the students in mind — we place top priority in creating engaging and exciting learning experiences. Our curriculum offers intellectually stimulating lesson materials that motivate and engage the students. These materials provide rich resources for teaching and learning so our staff are able to help each student achieve learning success.

**<u>Our Student Care Centre (SCC) Programmes</u>**

·      **CLS Homework Supervision Programme**

At Commit Learning SchoolHouse, we believe in first nurturing a love for learning in every child/ward that will pave his or her journey towards and beyond academic excellence. All these begin with cultivating the right attitude and morals through our CLS Homework Supervision Programme. Do note that SCC does not provide academic support programmes, which are instead carried out by pupils’ respective academic subject teachers.

·    **CLS Character Development Programme**

CLS character development program (LEADERSHIP) aims to inculcate positive values and qualities in our young leaders. Character development is a learning process that enables them to understand, care about and act on core ethical values such as respect, integrity, resilience, innovation and responsibility for self and others. With these core values ingrained in them, our young leaders are able to form the attitudes and actions to discern between right and wrong, make responsible choices and be aware of their roles in nation building.

·    **CLS Enrichment Programme**

The CLS Global Affairs section in CLS Enrichment Program (THINKER) challenges our students to think deeper, ask questions, explore and look at the world critically.  As a strong believer of striking a balance in work and play, holistic development for our students can be achieved through CLS Outdoor Activities (ENGAGING & EMPOWERING). These Outside-The-Classroom Outdoor Education Activities provide students with a well-rounded education. Friendships are forged, character is defined, limits are conquered and potential is unleashed.
