<h5>Commit Learning School House Profile Description</h5>
<p>Committing to a better tomorrow and excel beyond expectations. Commit
Learning SchoolHouse (CLS) is committed to design an interactive, participative
and technologically enabled learning Student Care Centre (SCC) holistic
experience to help every child to develop into broadly educated indiviudals,
with depth of knowledge and capabilities required to thrive in the 21st&nbsp;century
which complements every child’s primary school education.</p>
<p>Commit Learning SchoolHouse SCC programmes are aligned closely to the
MOE guidelines.&nbsp;Our curriculum has been thoughtfully designed with
the students in mind — we place top priority in creating engaging and exciting
learning experiences. Our curriculum offers intellectually stimulating
lesson materials that motivate and engage the students. These materials
provide rich resources for teaching and learning so our staff are able
to help each student achieve learning success.</p>
<p><strong><u>Our Student Care Centre (SCC) Programmes</u></strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>CLS Homework Supervision Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>At Commit Learning SchoolHouse, we believe in first nurturing a love for
learning in every child/ward that will pave his or her journey towards
and beyond academic excellence. All these begin with cultivating the right
attitude and morals through our CLS Homework Supervision Programme.&nbsp;Do
note that SCC does not provide academic support programmes, which are instead
carried out by pupils’ respective academic subject teachers.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>CLS Character Development Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>CLS character development program (LEADERSHIP) aims to inculcate positive
values and qualities in our young leaders. Character development is a learning
process that enables them to understand, care about and act on core ethical
values such as respect, integrity, resilience, innovation and responsibility
for self and others.&nbsp;With&nbsp;these core values ingrained in them,
our young leaders are able to form the attitudes and actions to discern
between right and wrong, make responsible choices and be aware of their
roles in nation building.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>CLS Enrichment Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The CLS Global Affairs section in CLS Enrichment Program (THINKER) challenges
our students to think deeper, ask questions, explore and look at the world
critically.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a strong believer of striking a balance in work
and play, holistic development for our students can be achieved through
CLS Outdoor Activities (ENGAGING &amp; EMPOWERING). These Outside-The-Classroom
Outdoor Education Activities provide students with a well-rounded education.
Friendships are forged, character is defined, limits are conquered and
potential is unleashed.</p>
