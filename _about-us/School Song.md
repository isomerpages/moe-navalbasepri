<h2>School Song</h2>
<p>Up the gangway, we will go
<br>Ready to achieve our goal
<br>Working together in harmony
<br>On Board our Naval Base Primary</p>
<p>Sail On, Sail On
<br>We'll ride the wildest storm
<br>Our spirits, brave and strong
<br>Soon the gale will be gone</p>
<p>Wave after wave, we will go
<br>Till we hear the shouts of â€˜Land Ahoy'
<br>Firm on the anchor of Education
<br>We'll do our best for our Nation</p>
<p><strong>Lyrics by : Mrs Wee Bian Hua</strong> 
<br><strong>Score by : Mdm Ho Kim Geok</strong>
<br><strong>Rearranged: Mr Joseph Lim and Mr Victor Lin</strong>
