## School Song

Up the gangway, we will go
Ready to achieve our goal
Working together in harmony
On Board our Naval Base Primary 

Sail On, Sail On
We'll ride the wildest storm
Our spirits, brave and strong
Soon the gale will be gone

Wave after wave, we will go 
Till we hear the shouts of
â€˜Land Ahoy'
Firm on the anchor of Education
We'll do our best for out Nation

**Lyrics by : Mrs Wee Bian Hua**
**Score by : Mdm Ho Kim Geok**
