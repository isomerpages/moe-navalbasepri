## Spaces and Facilities

A positive environment is instrumental in enriching Navalites' learning and physical well-being. Having undergone the PERI Upgrading Project since 2018, Navalites now enjoy new facilities that have been thoughtfully designed to support and further enhance their learning experience in school.  

The upgraded facilities will allow Navalites to be given the opportunities to create, explore and most importantly, embark on the joy of learning. <br>
<br>These new facilities include:
