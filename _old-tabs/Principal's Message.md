## PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE

<img style="width: 45%;" src="/images/Mrs%20Sita%20Singh.jpeg" align="left"> 

In education, we have a saying, “It takes a village to raise a child.” In Naval Base Primary School, our community and our teachers form that village. It is our mission to raise every child to be leaders capable of facing and rising to challenges.

Naval Base Primary School has been an integral part of the Yishun South community since 1988. It has continued to provide quality holistic education to generations of students who have moved on to contribute to society in myriad ways.

Grounded in the philosophy&nbsp;**_‘Every Child Matters’_**, our staff is unified in our aim to provide a vibrant and engaging learning experience for all our students. In NBPS, every child is seen as unique and every child is precious to us. We are committed to ensure that every child can benefit from a holistic education and be ready for the next phase upon graduation from primary school.&nbsp;

In Naval Base Primary, we place an emphasis on care and ensuring that our classrooms are warm, inviting and conducive for learning; our programmes are inclusive and that needs of all our students are looked into. Our students are the centre of all that we do and we ensure that every Navalite is supported to be able to thrive and maximise his or her potential.&nbsp;

Teaching and Learning at NBPS focuses on providing our students with strong foundations in numeracy and literacy. We have in place early intervention programmes to help every student progress in his or her learning. Teachers continuously upgrade their skills and competencies through professional development to ensure they are cognizant of the latest developments in curriculum and pedagogy. Their learning is transferred into innovative teaching strategies in the classroom to facilitate engaged learning. &nbsp;

Besides the rigorous academic programme, there is also a balanced focus on values and character development. Values are very much part of life in NBPS. Values are not only taught but also demonstrated in the actions of both staff and students. Various platforms such as CCAs, PAL (Programme for Active Learning), LLP (Learning for Life Programme), Student Leadership Programme, VIA (Values-in Action) and National Education initiatives are well placed to further reinforce values. Our character education programme includes the inculcation of SEL (social-emotional learning) competencies and 21CC (21st Century Competencies) to our students.&nbsp;

“It takes a village to raise a child” and NBPS makes every attempt to work closely with our stakeholders: the SAC (School Advisory Council), community partners and you, our parents, &nbsp;to enhance the learning experience of our students. We look forward to building upon these partnerships in the years to come.

We are committed to nurture every child fully, in a warm and happy environment, into citizens who will contribute to society in purposeful and meaningful ways.

Let us continue to work together to bring out the best in every Navalite!
