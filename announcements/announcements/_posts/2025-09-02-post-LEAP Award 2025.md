<p>Congratulations to Mrs Leong Peak Yen, proud recipient of the LEAP Award
2025!</p>
<p>On 29 August, Mrs Leong was honoured at the 14th LEAP Award Presentation
Ceremony by Minister for Education, Mr Desmond Lee. Out of 329 nominations
nationwide, she was recognised as one of just 20 outstanding educators
this year — a true testament to her passion, dedication, and the lasting
impact she has made on her students and colleagues.</p>
<p>The LEAP (Listening Educator for Advancement and Progress) Award was launched
in 2011 by our late President SR Nathan and is presented annually by the
Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan. It honours exceptional teachers who nurture
from the heart and believe in the potential of their students to excel
beyond their own expectations. The Award also seeks to inspire all teachers
in Singapore to continue striving as nurturing and effective educators.</p>
