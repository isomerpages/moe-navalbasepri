## Mathematics

### OUR APPROACH
----
  
We believe that every Navalite can excel in the learning and application of Mathematics. We hone students’ mathematical thinking and problem-solving skills through a scaffolded teaching approach with an emphasis on hands-on learning using <span style="color:red;">mathematical</span> manipulatives.  

### KEY PROGRAMMES
--------------

<u>**Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach (CPA Approach)**</u>

Across all levels, students have access to a wide variety of <span style="color:red">mathematical</span> manipulatives that are used in class to introduce mathematical concepts in a concrete and tangible manner. Students then progress on to pictorial representations before learning to solve abstract mathematical equations and problems.

**<u>Joy of Learning in Mathematics</u>**

Students of all levels explore and enjoy Mathematics beyond the curriculum and hone their logical thinking skills through various activities.

**(i) Logic Puzzles**

Students are taught to solve Sudoku and KenKen puzzles. The annual Intra-School Sudoku competition is a widely-anticipated event for Navalites.

**(ii) Breakout EDU**

Breakout <span style="color:red">EDU</span> kits are used to provide students with fun Mathematics challenges. Students work in groups and apply their knowledge of Mathematics to solve questions and unlock the Breakout Edu box during the P3 Breakout Edu experience and the P5 Math and Science Trail.

**<u>Admiral's Programme</u>**

**(i) Excellence 2000 Mathematics (E2K Mathematics)**

The E2K Mathematics program is offered to P4 and P5 students who show interest and ability in Mathematics. Students collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through puzzles, games and mathematics explorations. The rich learning experiences offered by the programme develop students’ reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach.

| -------- | -------- | 
|      |      | 


**(ii) Math Olympiad**

Math Olympiad workshops are offered to P5 and P6 students who have demonstrated high competence and interest in Mathematics. Students explore advanced mathematical concepts and non-routine questions beyond the syllabus.&nbsp; Through these workshops, students are better prepared for participation in national math competitions and learn higher-order thinking skills and strategies which allow them to excel academically.

|      |      | 


<u>**Learning Support For Mathematics (LSM)**</u>

Identified P1 to P4 students to enrol in the LSM programme to develop basic numeracy skills and confidence in Mathematics. Lessons are conducted in small groups for students to receive more individual attention and support from specially trained teachers.

**<u>Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)</u>**

P5 and P6 students identified to enroll in the ICAN programme to improve their confidence and performance in Mathematics. Lessons are conducted in small groups for trained ICAN teachers to better cater to each student’s learning needs.

**<u>Home-School Partnership</u>**

The bi-annual Parents’ Workshop for Mathematics equips parents with the skills to support their child in Mathematics learning at home. During the workshop, teachers share about the teaching frameworks and approaches used in class, as well as the potential difficulties faced by students. Parents have the opportunity to learn different heuristics and problem solving skills in a hands-on manner and pick up tips on helping their child to excel in Mathematics.
