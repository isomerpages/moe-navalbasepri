**MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM FOCUS**  

The objective of Mathematics education is to help pupils develop Mathematical Thinking and Problem Solving Skills so that they will be able to apply these skills when solving problems.

**PROBLEM SOLVING**

Involves application of problem solving and reasoning skills to tackle a variety of problems, including real-world problems.

Students use thinking skills and heuristics to solve word problems.

**Thinking Skills**

*   Classifying
*   Comparing
*   Sequencing
*   Generalising
*   Induction
*   Deduction
*   Analyzing
*   Synthesizing

**Heuristics**

*   Drawing a diagram
*   Tabulating
*   Guess and Check
*   Working Backwards
*   Simplifying a Problem
*   Considering Special Cases

**Naval Base Primary School’s Approach**

Naval Base Primary School aims to help students develop strong foundation in Primary Mathematics through a structured teaching sequence and supporting manipulatives and materials.

  
**KEY PROGRAMMES**

*   Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract

*   Sustained Support for Mathematics

*   Learning Support For Mathematics (LSM)  
      
    
*   Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)  
      
    
*   Excellence 2000 (Mathematics)  
      
    
*   Mathematics Olympiad

**What Parents Can Do to Help Their Child**

*   Work close with the Mathematics teacher to ensure the child has gained an understanding of the Mathematical Concept and acquired the standard Mathematical procedural workings  
      
    
*   Monitor the child’s learning at home and ensure the child completes all assignments on time.  
      
    
*   Practise Factual Fluency with the child at home  
      
    
*   Play Mathematical games and solve Mathematical games/puzzles with the child
