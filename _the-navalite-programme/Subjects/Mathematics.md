## Mathematics

### OUR APPROACH
----
  
We believe that every Navalite can excel in the learning and application of Mathematics. We hone studentsâ€™ mathematical thinking and problem-solving skills through a scaffolded teaching approach with an emphasis on hands-on learning using mathematical manipulatives.  

### KEY PROGRAMMES
--------------

Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach (CPA Approach)

Across all levels, students have access to a wide variety of mathematical manipulatives that are used in class to introduce mathematical concepts in a concrete and tangible manner. Students then progress on to pictorial representations before learning to solve abstract mathematical equations and problems.
