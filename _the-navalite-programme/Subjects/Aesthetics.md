## Aesthetics

##### OUR APPROACH (Example: philosophy, student outcomes, framework)

###### “The Arts for Every Child”

We believe that all Navalites should be given opportunities to learn about, appreciate and excel in the Arts. Hence, all Navalites have learning experiences and programmes in Art, Music, Dance and Drama throughout their six years in the school.

##### KEY PROGRAMMES

###### <u>Art and Music Programmes (P1 - P6)</u>

In our well-equipped Art and Music rooms, Navalites learn various techniques and skills to create, share, perform and appreciate Art and Music. 

For Art, the six-year programme encourages Navalites to explore deeply in the focus areas of:<br>
(i) Self and Immediate Environment, <br>
(ii) Singapore Past, Present and Future, and <br>
(iii) The World and Region We Live in. 

Through these focus areas, Navalites learn to <b>see, express and appreciate</b> various art genres and styles.

For Music, the six-year programme focuses on providing students with a rich experience in <b>listening to, creating and performing music. </b>Through these musical processes, students gain an understanding of musical elements, concepts and knowledge as well as the context of the variety of musical styles they are exposed to.

At Primary 6, the Art and Music programme culminates in a special year-long interdisciplinary project to create educational digital games. This project is part of the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) “Constructionist Game Design” where Navalites use the Design Thinking framework to<br><br>
(i) design their game characters using the application Procreate <br>
(ii) compose their game music using the application GarageBand and <br>
(iii) code their educational games to life.

###### <u>Arts Beat Carnival</u>

Navalites enjoy a week filled with arts with an assembly talk, art exhibition, Navalite performances, and a variety of recess activities. In particular, members of Aesthetics CCAs such as Art Club, Band, Choir, Dance and Drama Club also have the opportunity to display their creative talents and share their skills with their peers. The carnival ends off on a high note with a hands-on parent-child bonding session where both parent and child engage in arts-related activities together and foster stronger bonds during the process.

###### <u>Navalites Got Talent</u>

Held twice a year, top-voted finalists stand a chance to be featured during assembly. Besides musical and artistic talents, Navalites also enthusiastically share their skills in sports and martial arts and even cooking! Participants and finalists receive beautifully designed certificates and badges to acknowledge their efforts.

###### <u>Navalite Compass and Bookmark Competition (Art Competition)</u>

Every year, all Navalites are welcome to submit their designs for the cover and bookmark of their student handbook, known as the “Navalite Compass”. The shortlisted designs go through a round of voting by Navalites and the winning entry is used for the Navalite Compass in the following year. Through this competition, Navalites have an opportunity to express their pride and sense of belonging to the school.

###### <u>Theatre Experience </u>

Primary 3s can look forward to a learning journey to watch a professional play or musical at a theatre. Beyond being exposed to this genre of arts, Navalites are taught theatre etiquette and are encouraged to apply them in this authentic and experiential programme.

###### <u>Museum-Based Learning</u>

We are proud to collaborate with National Gallery Singapore where selected Artworks are reprinted and displayed at The Navalite Gallery. Navalites will have the opportunity to experience museum-based learning conveniently within the school compound every year.

At Primary 4, in collaboration with Social Studies, Navalites will journey to National Gallery Singapore and find out more about Singaporean artists and artworks, as well as Singapore’s history.
