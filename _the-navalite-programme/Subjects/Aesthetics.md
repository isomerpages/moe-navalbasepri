#### ARTS BEAT CARNIVAL

In line with the school’s continuous efforts to provide a holistic development for our students, our annual Arts Beat Carnival (ABC) helps to increase our students’ exposure to different arts forms across the Visual and Performing Arts. It also creates a platform for students to showcase their artistic talents and skills. The photos below offer a glimpse of some of the activities that are carried out during the week-long carnival:
