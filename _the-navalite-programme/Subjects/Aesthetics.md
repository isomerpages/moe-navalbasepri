## Aesthetics

##### OUR APPROACH (Example: philosophy, student outcomes, framework)

###### “The Arts for Every Child”

We believe that all Navalites should be given opportunities to learn about, appreciate and excel in the Arts. Hence, all Navalites have learning experiences and programmes in Art, Music, Dance and Drama throughout their six years in the school.

##### OUR APPROACH (Example: philosophy, student outcomes, framework)

##### KEY PROGRAMMES 

###### <u>Art and Music Programmes (P1 - P6)</u>

In our well-equipped Art and Music rooms, Navalites learn various techniques and skills to create, share, perform and appreciate Art and Music. 

For Art, the six-year programme encourages Navalites to explore deeply in the focus areas of:<br>
(i) Self and Immediate Environment, <br>
(ii) Singapore Past, Present and Future, and <br>
(iii) The World and Region We Live in. 

Through these focus areas, Navalites learn to <b>see, express and appreciate</b> various art genres and styles.

##### PROGRAMME FOR ACTIVE LEARNING – PAL (P1 & 2 ONLY)

During PAL, students are exposed to varied and fun learning experiences in four domains: Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts. Students also learn socio-emotional competencies such as respecting others and responsible decision making.

##### ARTS BEAT CARNIVAL

In line with the school’s continuous efforts to provide a holistic development for our students, our annual Arts Beat Carnival (ABC) helps to increase our students’ exposure to different arts forms across the Visual and Performing Arts. It also creates a platform for students to showcase their artistic talents and skills. The photos below offer a glimpse of some of the activities that are carried out during the week-long carnival:

Newly introduced in 2020, Navalites Got Talent is a recess talent showcase where students can sign up to perform for their peers during recess. Students perform individually or in groups with their friends, and show-off their skills ranging from singing, dancing to playing an instrument.

This year, due to the Safe Management Measures in schools, students recorded and submitted their performances from the comfort of their homes instead. Their performances were showcased digitally to their schoolmates via SLS as well as through Zoom during assembly.

##### AESTHETICS OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNING

**Learning Journey – An experience at a Drama/Musical** 

In collaboration with the English department, All P3 students will attend a play/musical. Students learn to practice their school values and learn about theatre etiquette. At the end of the learning journey, students return back to class to write about their experiences in their journals.

##### AESTHETICS IN-HOUSE COMPETITION 

Each year, the school organises the “Navalite Compass and Bookmark Competition” for students to submit their designs for the cover and bookmark of their student handbook, known as the “Navalite Compass”. The shortlisted designs then go through a round of voting by the students and the winning entry will be used as the design of the Navalite Compass for the following year. Through this competition, students have an opportunity to express their pride in NBPS through drawing while having a greater ownership over the handbook that they bring to school every day.
