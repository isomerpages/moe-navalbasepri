## English

## OUR APPROACH  

We want to empower Navalites to be effective communicators and confident users of the English Language. We believe that language use is guided by an awareness of purpose, the audience, context and culture in which the communication is to take place.

KEY PROGRAMMES
--------------

#### IREAD@NBPS

  
iREAD@NBPS is an integrated approach that focuses on extensive reading across the EL Curriculum. The objective of iREAD is to cultivate a love for the English Language and improve the overall language proficiency of our students. Reading is important as it provides an authentic learning experience for our students to learn the fundamentals of the language and a means to improve oral and written proficiency.

In order to cultivate a reading culture, the whole school spends 15 minutes of Sustained Silent Reading (SSR) before assembly each day.

We cater to the learning needs of our students with our Morning Reading Programme where Allied Educators, Teacher Assistants, Learning Support Coordinators, teachers and student leaders provide extra support in reading twice a week in the morning.

KidsREAD is conducted once a week to immerse Primary 1 and 2 students, who experience financial difficulties, in the joy of reading widely. The students listen to stories read to them by volunteers, do hands-on activities, and read to the volunteers other books which are provided to them.  


#### LA FIESTA

A fun-filled week of games, story-telling, poem creation, songwriting and more, La Fiesta ignites the love in the learning of English in our Navalites. 

Our Primary 1 students engage in Show and Tell on their favourite storybook character while those in Primary 2 share the fairy tale which they enjoy the most through storytelling. Our teachers add a special touch by dressing up as famous book characters in a Character Walk during the Primary 1 and 2 recesses! 

Primary 3 students learn about poetry and recite poems while Primary 4 students try their hands at movie poster creation. Last but not the least, our Primary 5 and 6 Navalites unleash their creativity through poem and song-writing respectively.
