### PHILOSOPHY

  

We want to empower every student to be effective communicators and confident users of the English Language. We believe that language use is guided by an awareness of purpose, the audience, context and culture in which the communication is to take place.

  

#### IREAD@NBPS

  

iREAD@NBPS is an integrated approach that focuses on extensive reading across the EL Curriculum. The objective of iREAD is to cultivate a love for the English Language and improve the overall language proficiency of our students. Reading is important as it provides an authentic learning experience for our students to learn the fundamentals of the language and a means to improve oral and written proficiency.

In order to cultivate a reading culture, the whole school spends 15 minutes of **Sustained Silent Reading (SSR)** before assembly (SSR) each day.

We cater to the learning needs of our students with our **Extensive Reading Programme** and **KidsREAD** where Allied Educators, Teacher Assistants, Learning Support Coordinators, teachers and student leaders provide extra support in reading twice a week in the morning.


### READING UNDER THE STARS

Reading Under the Stars is a fun night of books, bonding and a lot more at NBPS. In order to ignite the love for reading in P1 students, the night was lined up with an exciting programme for parents and children who came dressed in their pyjamas or a favourite storybook character.

Those who attended the event were treated to activities such as a read-together session, students' drama and teachers' performance. Parents were also equipped with Reading Aloud strategies and ideas to motivate their children in reading books and how to create a reading culture at home.

### LIBRARY RECESS ACTIVITIES

Aligned to our department philosophy, to empower every student to be effective communicators and confident users of the English Language, the Primary 1 and 2 students take turns to tell a story at our school library. This is a platform for our young ones to build up their confidence interacting with an audience. For the P3 to P6 students, they have a chance at showcasing their talent in story-telling, acting and singing every Thursdays. Our students look forward to these activities.
