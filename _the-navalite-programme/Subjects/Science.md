#### OUR APPROACH
------------

Naval Base Primary School strives to provide our students with different experiences and opportunities for them to enjoy, love and learn Science by seeing the relevance in their lives. From classroom discussions to hands-on activities, experiments and learning journeys, we aim to spark curiosity and build interest in Science through daily life.  

 
#### KEY PROGRAMMES
--------------

**<u>Science In The Classroom</u>**

From Data Loggers to Science Toys to Individual Science Kits, Naval Base Primary School has a wealth of resources for our students to delve into hands-on experiences during Science learning. Together with inquiry-based approaches, the 5E learning cycle is also used to support scientific inquiry across the five themes in the Primary Science Curriculum (Diversity, Cycles, Systems, Energy and Interactions).

###### **<u>LEARNING BEYOND THE CLASSROOM</u>**

Primary 3 to 6 students go on learning journeys, such as to the Singapore Zoo and the Science Centre where they engage in hands-on experiences with the vast resources from both organisations.&nbsp;

P5 students also have the opportunity to attend a Terrarium Workshop to understand and apply the concepts of the Water Cycle. Beyond external organisations, Navalites also get to connect with their surroundings through our Outdoor Education Learning area and Edible garden to cultivate their love and curiosity for nature and the environment.

**<u>Admiralâ€™s Programme (Science)</u>**

We offer opportunities for upper primary Navalites who demonstrate interest and ability in Science to participate in Science enrichment programmes and competitions.

**(i) Excellence 2000 Science Programme (E2K SCIENCE)**

The E2K Science Programme Singapore is a Science enrichment programme for P4 and P5 students who demonstrate keen interest and competence in Science. The programme aims to develop scientific inquiry process skills and nurture 21st Century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills.
