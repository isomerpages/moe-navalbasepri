## Science

#### PHILOSOPHY

We believe that, intrinsically, our students love Science. They enjoy and learn Science best when they see the relevance to their lives. In Naval Base Primary School, our team of Science teachers strive to provide our students with experiences that build on this interest. From classroom discussions to hands-on activities, experiments and learning journeys, we aim to spark curiosity and build interest in Science through daily life.

#### SCIENCE IN THE CLASSROOM

Our students have opportunities to conduct investigations with the wealth of science resources available in NBPS. From Data Loggers to Science Toys to Individual Science Kits, student engagement and interest heightens as they delve into these hands-on experiences. Across the five themes in the Primary Science Curriculum (Diversity, Cycles, Systems, Energy and Interactions), teachers apply the inquiry-based approach to help students gain Scientific Literacy and concepts. Teachers carry out the 5E learning cycle, which supports scientific inquiry in the teaching and learning of Science.

#### LEARNING BEYOND THE CLASSROOM

Our Science lessons take our students beyond the walls of the classroom. We arrange learning journeys to the Singapore Science Centre for our Primary 3 to 6 students where they have greater hands-on experiences with the vast resources that the Science Centre provides. To bring relevance to what they learn, for example, Primary 5 students go through a Terrarium Workshop to understand the concepts of the Water Cycle. Through our Outdoor Education Learning area, we hope to cultivate our students love for nature and the environment.

#### EXCELLENCE 2000 SCIENCE PROGRAMME (E2K SCIENCE)

The E2K Science Programme Singapore is a Science enrichment programme for upper primary students who demonstrate interest and ability in Science. The programme is adapted from Israelâ€™s E2K Programme which is developed by the Israel Centre for Excellence through Education (ICEE). The programme aims to develop scientific inquiry process skills among high-ability primary students in Science, as well as nurture other important 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills.
