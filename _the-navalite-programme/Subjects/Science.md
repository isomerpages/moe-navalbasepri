## Science

#### PHILOSOPHY

We believe that, intrinsically, our students love Science. They enjoy and learn Science best when they see the relevance to their lives. In Naval Base Primary School, our team of Science teachers strive to provide our students with experiences that build on this interest. From classroom discussions to hands-on activities, experiments and learning journeys, we aim to spark curiosity and build interest in Science through daily life.

#### SCIENCE IN THE CLASSROOM

Our students have opportunities to conduct investigations with the wealth of science resources available in NBPS. From Data Loggers to Science Toys to Individual Science Kits, student engagement and interest heightens as they delve into these hands-on experiences. Across the five themes in the Primary Science Curriculum (Diversity, Cycles, Systems, Energy and Interactions), teachers apply the inquiry-based approach to help students gain Scientific Literacy and concepts. Teachers carry out the 5E learning cycle, which supports scientific inquiry in the teaching and learning of Science.
