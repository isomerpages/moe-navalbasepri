### ABOUT BASKETBALL

  

_**PASSION TO SUCCEED**_

  
NBPS Basketball CCA’s mission is to develop students with interest in the game.  “ACES” (a name we call our NBPS Basketballers), will receive not just training to both their physical and mental strength, but also learn more about skills, rules, values and foundation for the sport.

Members have the opportunities to participate in various internal and external competitions such as the North Zone Competition. Inter-school friendly matches are organised to enhance their knowledge of the game. Through preparing and participating in these programmes, we aim to instill values of teamwork, resilience and self-discipline in our members.

#### NAVALITES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FOLLOWING EVENTS / COMPETITIONS:

*   North Zone Senior/Junior Competition
*   Active SG Coaching Camp
