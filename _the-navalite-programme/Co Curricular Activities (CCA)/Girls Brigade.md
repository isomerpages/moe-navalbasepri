### ABOUT GIRLS' BRIGADE

![](/images/gb1.png)

The mission of The Girls’ Brigade 63rd Company is to develop each girl to her fullest potential by equipping, empowering and enabling them to become servant leaders.
  
Self-discipline is the cornerstone of any uniformed groups. Through regular drill sessions, we instill the value of self-discipline to develop leadership in the girls who can lead their peers by example. 

In addition, we provide abundant opportunities for the girls to form supportive friendships and to acquire leadership skills through fun-filled and meaningful activities (e.g. camps, community involvement projects, etc.). 

The girls learn essential moral values such as compassion and respect through community service to prepare them for servant leadership.

### NAVALITES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FOLLOWING EVENTS AND COMPETITIONS:

Our girls actively contribute their services to the community through GB Friendship Day where they join girls from other companies to serve the special segments in the community by befriending the elderly folks, and those with special needs. 

  

Each year, selected girls represent our company to attend Junior Leadership Training Camp and Fast Food and Fuzz Camp organized by the Girls’ Brigade Headquarters. The girls are equipped with relevant knowledge and skills to lead confidently through experiential learning. They have learnt to be appreciative and thankful for what they have.

  

Our girls are also provided with opportunities to plan events such as community service to the school and old folks’ home under the guidance of the Girls’ Brigade officers and teachers.

### OUR ACHIEVEMENTS:

The GB 63rd Singapore Company started in NBPS in 2004. Since our inauguration, we have clinched the The Girls’ Brigade Singapore Company (63rd Co) Award (Gold), the highest prestige by The Girls’ Brigade Singapore, annually for our contribution and success in grooming our girls into servant leaders. We have also achieved the Gold Award in the Low Guat Tin Challenge 2017.
