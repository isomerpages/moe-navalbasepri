### ABOUT ART CLUB

NBPS Art Club is a place where students who are interested in art come together to deepen their interest through working on different art projects and have opportunities to interact with other students with similar interests in art.

  

According to Lev Vygotsky, a renowned psychologist, “it must not be forgotten that the basic law of children’s creativity is that its value lies not in its results, not in the product of creation, but in the process itself. It is not important what children create, but that they do create, that they exercise and implement their creative imagination.”

  

Art Club hopes to give opportunities to every member to express themselves freely through art and to build their confidence and courage in exercising their creativity.
