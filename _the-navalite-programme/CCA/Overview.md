Primary 3 to Primary 6 Navalites have a wide selection of CCAs to participate in, such as Sports, Uniformed Groups, Visual and Performing Arts or Clubs and Societies. Through CCAs, Navalites not only learn relevant content and skills in the respective areas but also important life skills and values such as leadership, teamwork, passion and resilience. Students have the opportunity to participate in various events and competitions through their CCAs such as the Singapore Youth Festival, Zonal, Divisional and National competitions.
