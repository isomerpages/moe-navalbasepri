### ABOUT INFOCOMM CLUB

NBPS Infocomm Club aims to excite students about infocomm in a fun and meaningful way by helping them to learn new infocomm skills and to cultivate leadership and entrepreneurship capabilities at an early age. 

  

Our Infocomm Club programme is aligned with the MOE's Leadership, Enrichment, Achievement, Participation and Service (LEAPS) framework where students acquire infocomm skills and cultivate leadership and entrepreneurship capabilities at an early age.

  

Under the close guidance of our teachers and trainer, students learn coding, digital photography and post-production skills. 

  

Through the club activities, students can appreciate technologies better, and creatively apply their skills to communicate ideas and use them in their school work.

  

#### PARTICIPATION IN THE FOLLOWING EVENTS / COMPETITIONS:

Students with potential for photography are trained and given opportunities to practise their photography skills during school events like Chinese New Year and National Day. They also learn to write coding programs using different coding platforms like Scratch and Micro:bit. Students are given opportunities to represent the school in competitions like The 3D-Tronics Micro:bit Asia Challenge and Photography Competition such as ‘My School, My Stories’.
