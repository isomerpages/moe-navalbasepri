## APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME (ALP)

The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) connects classroom learning with real-life applications and encourages students to creatively apply concepts to solve authentic problems. ALP focuses on evoking curiosity in learning, developing inventive thinking and encouraging a dare-to-try spirit.

The ALP “Constructionist Game Design” focuses on interdisciplinary learning. As the title suggests, Navalites embark on projects spanning across various subjects and levels and are given opportunities to progress from being a mere consumer of games to a creative game producer. The programme culminates in Primary 6 where Navalites embark on a year-long project to create all aspects of an educational digital game - from planning the storyboard, designing their game characters, composing their music tracks to coding their game to fruition.
