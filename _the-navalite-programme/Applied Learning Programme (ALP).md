<h2>APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME (ALP)</h2>
<p>The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) connects classroom learning with
solving real-life authentic problems which develops <em>critica</em>l, <em>adaptive</em> and <em>inventive</em> thinkers.</p>
<p>The ALP “Constructionist Game Design” taps on students’ innate interest
in games to develop <em>Emerging 21st Century Competencies</em>&nbsp; through
an interdisciplinary approach. Navalites embark on projects spanning across
various subjects and levels and will:</p>
<p>
<br>1. Learn through games.</p>
<p>2. Transform from being a mere <strong>consumer</strong> of games to be
a creative <strong>producer</strong> of games.</p>
