#### INTEGRATION OF TECHNOLOGY IN CURRICULUM

In NBPS, teaching and learning with technology is hinged by the Student Learning Space (SLS) Pedagogical Scaffold that guides teachers in the design of meaningful ICT-enabled student-centric learning experiences. Emerging technologies are also harnessed to create meaningful learning experiences that bridge students’ acquisition of content knowledge and the development of digital literacy skills and 21st century competency skills.

These collective experiences aim to develop Navalites' confidence in expressing their understanding and thoughts during their learning process. By collaborating and contributing actively to the learning process, Navalites can hone their critical thinking skills to deepen their learning. The use of SLS also empowers Navalites to assume greater ownership of their learning as they explore quality curriculum-aligned resources for self-paced learning.

#### DEEPENING DIGITAL LEARNING IN NEW MEDIA LITERACY

Digital literacy and fluency are imperative for Navalites to thrive in an increasingly digital landscape. In NBPS, students undergo designed ICT baseline lessons to acquire the skills to curate information, connect in the digital space and co-create with technology.
