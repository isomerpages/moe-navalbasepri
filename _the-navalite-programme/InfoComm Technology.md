<h2>INFOCOMM TECHNOLOGY</h2>
<h3>OUR GOAL</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Nurture future-ready and responsible digital learners</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>KEY OBJECTIVES</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Integrate the use of technology in teaching and learning&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deepen digital learning in new media literacy&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop digital citizenship&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide opportunities for students to innovate and co-create with technology&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>INTEGRATION OF TECHNOLOGY IN CURRICULUM</h4>
<p>In NBPS, teaching and learning with technology is hinged by the Student
Learning Space (SLS) Pedagogical Scaffold that guides teachers in the design
of meaningful ICT-enabled student-centric learning experiences.&nbsp;Emerging
technologies are also harnessed to create meaningful learning experiences
that bridge studentsâ€™ acquisition of content knowledge and the development
of digital literacy skills and 21st&nbsp;century competency skills.</p>

<p>These collective experiences aim to develop Navalites' confidence in expressing
their understanding and thoughts during their learning process. By collaborating
and contributing actively to the learning process, Navalites can hone their
critical thinking skills to deepen their learning. The use of SLS also
empowers Navalites to assume greater ownership of their learning as they
explore quality curriculum-aligned resources for self-paced learning.</p>
<h4>DEEPENING DIGITAL LEARNING IN NEW MEDIA LITERACY</h4>
<p>Digital literacy and fluency are imperative for Navalites to thrive in
an increasingly digital landscape.&nbsp;In NBPS, students undergo designed
ICT baseline lessons to acquire the skills to curate information, connect
in the digital space and co-create with technology.</p>

<h4>DEVELOPING DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP</h4>
<p>In the digital age, one needs to be discerning in their use of the Internet
and media.&nbsp;Through our programmes which are anchored on the principles
of cyber wellness (CW), Navalites&nbsp;develop informed opinions on the
responsible use of technology to become responsible masters of technology
tomorrow.</p>
<p>Some of these programmes include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Awareness talks by guest speakers and CW Ambassadors during assembly talks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self-management sharing during FTGP lessons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engagement activities to learn about positive online habits during recesses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appointment and training of CW Ambassadors to assert positive peer influence</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the year,&nbsp;<strong>Home-Based-Learning (HBL) sessions</strong>&nbsp;will
also be conducted. We encourage parents and guardians of Navalites to partner
us in taking on an active role in&nbsp;protecting and empowering Navalites
to take responsibility for their own well-being in the cyberspace.&nbsp;You

<p>At NBPS, every learner matters. We work actively with eligible households
to acquire their own Internet-enabled computing devices through the&nbsp;<strong>NEU PC Plus programme</strong>&nbsp;<strong>that offers low-income households with the opportunity to do so at an affordable price</strong>.

find out more or approach our General Office for further assistance.</p>
<h4>PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INNOVATION AND CO-CREATION WITH TECHNOLOGY&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong><u>Navalite Discovery Day (NDD)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Since 2017, Primary 3 and Primary 4 Navalites are challenged to exercise
their critical and inventive thinking skills to propose innovative solutions
to real world problems during NDD.&nbsp;With information easily accessible
at their fingertips, Navalites are given the opportunities to access infinite
knowledge, apply them to real world problems and to realise the impact
they can make through their innovations. In the process, Navalites apply
their new media literacy skills to curate, connect and create digital artefacts.</p>
<p><strong><u>Code For Fun (CFF)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Starting 2020, Primary 5 Navalites undergo an extensive 10-hours CFF Programme
to learn more about computational thinking, programming&nbsp;and artificial&nbsp;intelligence.
Besides learning to use a block-based programming to write a code for the
Sphero Bot to complete specific challenges, they also learn about the applications
of artificial&nbsp;intelligence to improve the quality of life.</p>
<p><strong><u>Game-Making</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In close collaboration with the Aesthetics Department, Primary 6 Navalites
embark on a coding programme to learn about games creation during their
Art and Music lessons. Through the programme, Navalites learn to code their
own games and to insert customized elements of music and characters.</p>
