## INFOCOMM TECHNOLOGY


### OUR GOAL


*   Nurture future-ready and responsible digital learners

  

### KEY OBJECTIVES


*   Integrate the use of technology in teaching and learning 
*   Deepen digital learning in new media literacy 
*   Develop digital citizenship  
*   Provide opportunities for students to innovate and co-create with technology 


#### INTEGRATION OF TECHNOLOGY IN CURRICULUM

In NBPS, teaching and learning with technology is hinged by the Student Learning Space (SLS) Pedagogical Scaffold that guides teachers in the design of meaningful ICT-enabled student-centric learning experiences. Emerging technologies are also harnessed to create meaningful learning experiences that bridge students’ acquisition of content knowledge and the development of digital literacy skills and 21st century competency skills.

These collective experiences aim to develop Navalites' confidence in expressing their understanding and thoughts during their learning process. By collaborating and contributing actively to the learning process, Navalites can hone their critical thinking skills to deepen their learning. The use of SLS also empowers Navalites to assume greater ownership of their learning as they explore quality curriculum-aligned resources for self-paced learning.

#### DEEPENING DIGITAL LEARNING IN NEW MEDIA LITERACY

Digital literacy and fluency are imperative for Navalites to thrive in an increasingly digital landscape. In NBPS, students undergo designed ICT baseline lessons to acquire the skills to curate information, connect in the digital space and co-create with technology.

#### DEVELOPING DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP

In the digital age, one needs to be discerning in their use of the Internet and media. Through our programmes which are anchored on the principles of cyber wellness (CW), Navalites develop informed opinions on the responsible use of technology to become responsible masters of technology tomorrow.

Some of these programmes include:

*   Awareness talks by guest speakers and CW Ambassadors during assembly talks
*   Self-management sharing during FTGP lessons
*   Engagement activities to learn about positive online habits during recesses
*   Appointment and training of CW Ambassadors to assert positive peer influence

Throughout the year, **Home-Based-Learning (HBL) sessions** will also be conducted. We encourage parents and guardians of Navalites to partner us in taking on an active role in protecting and empowering Navalites to take responsibility for their own well-being in the cyberspace. You can click **[here](http://ictconnection.moe.edu.sg/cyber-wellness/for-parents)** to find out more about CW tips.

At NBPS, every learner matters. We work actively with eligible households to acquire their own Internet-enabled computing devices through the **NEU PC Plus programme** **that offers low-income households with the opportunity to do so at an affordable price**. Please click **[here](https://www.imda.gov.sg/programme-listing/neu-pc-plus)** to find out more or approach our General Office for further assistance.

#### PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INNOVATION AND CO-CREATION WITH TECHNOLOGY 

**<u>Navalite Discovery Day (NDD)</u>**

Since 2017, Primary 3 and Primary 4 Navalites are challenged to exercise their critical and inventive thinking skills to propose innovative solutions to real world problems during NDD. With information easily accessible at their fingertips, Navalites are given the opportunities to access infinite knowledge, apply them to real world problems and to realise the impact they can make through their innovations. In the process, Navalites apply their new media literacy skills to curate, connect and create digital artefacts.

**<u>Code For Fun (CFF)</u>**

Starting 2020, Primary 5 Navalites undergo an extensive 10-hours CFF Programme to learn more about computational thinking, programming and artificial intelligence. Besides learning to use a block-based programming to write a code for the Sphero Bot to complete specific challenges, they also learn about the applications of artificial intelligence to improve the quality of life.

**<u>Game-Making</u>**

In close collaboration with the Aesthetics Department, Primary 6 Navalites embark on a coding programme to learn about games creation during their Art and Music lessons. Through the programme, Navalites learn to code their own games and to insert customized elements of music and characters.
