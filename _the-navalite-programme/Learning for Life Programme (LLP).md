<h2>Learning for Life Programme</h2>
<p></p>
<h4>Healthy living, Outdoor appreciation, Personal Effort &amp; Service (HOPES)</h4>
<p>The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) â€œHOPES'' aims to expose, excite
and enhance students' experience of the outdoors and sports towards a lifelong
involvement and pursuit of a healthy lifestyle. The programme consists
of a series of sports and outdoor experiences that seeks to develop leadership
awareness and skills in all Navalites. It also supports our school vision
of Every Navalite a Leader. In partnership with ActiveSG, Navalites are
exposed to a wide variety of outdoor experiences and sports activities
such as mini tennis and football. Highlights include the annual Primary
4 and 5 Outdoor Adventure Camps.</p>
