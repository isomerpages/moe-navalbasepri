## Student Well Being

### FORM TEACHER GUIDANCE PERIOD (FTGP)

With the PERI initiatives coming ahead, MOE has established new structures to better support schools to implement the recommendations outlined by the PERI committee. One of the new structures that will be in place is the Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP). FTGP serves as an additional platform for Form Teachers and Co-form teachers to build better rapport with the students so as to enable them to identify the needs of the students and provide better support for them.

INTERACTION TIME (I-TIME)
-------------------------

This programme gives both teachers and students the platform to meet up on a personal basis individually. Through this interaction, teachers are able to meet the individual students at least once a semester to get to know them better. This interaction also serves as a tool to motivate the students not only excel in academics but also serves to help further enhance the character development of the child. 

The objectives of the programme are to:

*       build a positive personal relationship with our students
*       generate mutual respect and trust.
*       create a conducive and happier teaching and learning environment.
*       reach out to students letting them know that we care

### EDUCATION AND CAREER GUIDANCE (ECG)


Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their lives. Through ECG, social emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience are developed to prepare students for the 21st Century.

**Primary School Emphasis: Awareness**

Goal: 

To introduce students to the wide array of occupations, including new jobs created in this ever-changing world-of-work. 

Students will develop an awareness of their:      

*   interests, abilities and career aspirations
*   relation of self to others and work
*   initial preferences in career roles assumed in play

**a) ECG in FTGP lessons**

These lessons and interaction activities are designed to:

*   raise students’ awareness of their strengths and interests
*   help them plan their educational pathway and select secondary schools
*   provide more opportunities to explore different careers and nurture their aspirations for the future.  

**b) Career Talks** 

The students attend career talks by our staff who have been in other occupations, such as a nurse and executive in a shipping firm during FTGP lessons.

**c) Career Guidance Seminar** 

Every year, our P6 students attend career talks by invited guest speakers. They learn insights about different careers, as they get up close and personal with them during the sharing sessions.

  

In 2020, we invited social workers, a make-up artist & businesswoman, a corporate tax officer(an ex student) and a pastry chef. The sharing was conducted via zoom.

  

The guest speakers shared on the following with the students:

\- What are the qualifications/skills to be a/an….

\- What are the values/qualities one must have to be a/an….

\- What do they enjoy being a/an….

\- What are the challenges that they come across in this job...

  

There was certainly much interaction and learning by the students during the seminar.

  
**d) Career Trails**

The P1 and P2 students go on a Career Trail to find out more about the different jobs available in the school such as staff in the general office, canteen stallholder and bookshop. Students certainly have fun doing this as they went around the school interviewing these people.

**e) Career Learning Journey** 

As part of NBPS educational career guidance, we aim to expose our students to a wide variety of careers so that they may make an informed decision in the future.

i) In 2019, our P6 students participated in the learning journey to KidZania Singapore at Sentosa.

ii) KidZania also came to our school and set up booths comprising several occupations so that students have an extended hands-on experience.

iii) Some students also had the opportunity to visit a law firm at Marina One to learn more about being a lawyer. There was much interaction between the lawyer and the students during this learning journey.

### MOE SEXUALITY EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS

Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.
