## Student Leadership

#### CHARACTER

  

##### OUR PHILOSOPHY

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) has always been at the heart of education in Singapore. It is central to the 21st Century Competencies Framework and emphasizes the interconnectedness of the core values, social and emotional competencies and civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills that are critical for character and citizenship development of our students.

CCE has always been at the heart of education in Naval Base Primary School. The school vision which comprises of the CCE Outcomes is at the core of our Character and Citizenship Development Framework. It anchors what we seek to achieve in our students at the end of their 6 years in NBPS. The CCE Outcomes are rooted in our School Values. NBPS has adopted a student-centric approach in ensuring our students are well-supported socially, emotionally and morally throughout their 6-year stay in school through the infusion of SEL and 21st CC Skills. NBPS has a team of teachers, counsellors and allied educators dedicated to develop and implement both instructional and co-curricular programmes to provide for the holistic development of our students.

Student Leadership Committee has established a comprehensive system to develop and maximise the leadership potential of all Navalites. The Student Leadership Framework supports the vision of “Every Individual a Leader” and is anchored on SEL Competencies, School Values and 21st CC Skills to shape the beliefs, attitudes and the actions of a Navalite.

#### PARENTS' INVOLVEMENT

  

Students are encouraged to perform everyday responsibilities in these areas:

\- At Home  

\- In School

\- In the Community

 
Parents can involve their children in some simple tasks to teach their children on how to take care of their shared spaces, so as to develop a sense of responsibility beyond the classroom.
