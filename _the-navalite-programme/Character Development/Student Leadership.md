<h2>Student Leadership</h2>
<h2><strong>Empowering Every Child to Lead with Heart: Our Student Leadership Framework</strong></h2>
<p>At Naval Base Primary School, we believe that every child has the potential
to lead—not just with their heads, but with their hearts. Anchored in the
philosophy of Servant Leadership, our Student Leadership Framework is designed
to nurture compassionate, confident, and community-minded individuals who
live out the core values of Self-Discipline, Integrity, Respect, Compassion,
and Lifelong Learning.</p>
<p>Our leadership journey is more than just about roles—it's about developing
responsible citizens, self-directed learners, and collaborative contributors
who are future-ready. Guided by the 21st Century Competencies (21CC) and
Social-Emotional Learning (SEL), our programme shapes students into thoughtful
leaders who care deeply, work cooperatively, and lead courageously.</p>

<h3><strong>A Leadership Journey in Four Stages</strong></h3>
<p>Our Student Leadership Framework follows a <strong>four-stage developmental cycle</strong>:
<br><strong>Selection → Training → Application → Evaluation<br></strong>This
intentional structure empowers every student to grow into their leadership
potential, at every level of school life.</p>
<h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Selection – Spotting Potential, Nurturing Growth</strong></h3>
<p>Leadership at Naval Base Primary begins with recognising potential. We
identify students who not only display leadership promise but also uphold
our school values in their everyday actions. As they grow, students have
structured opportunities to progress into deeper leadership roles:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Trainee Prefects</strong> who evolve into <strong>Prefects</strong>
</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Green Monitors</strong> who take on greater
stewardship as <strong>Environment Ambassadors</strong>
</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NESS Monitors</strong> who advocate for
national and social awareness as <strong>NESS Ambassadors</strong>
</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Well-being Monitors</strong> who champion
kindness and peer support as <strong>Kindness Ambassadors</strong> or <strong>Peer Support Leaders</strong>
</p>
<h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Training – Growing Leaders from Within</strong></h3>
<p>Through a thoughtfully designed <strong>annual leadership training programme</strong>,
our student leaders engage in workshops and experiential learning that
build leadership skills and a deep sense of unity. More importantly, students
are empowered to reflect, propose, and act on ways to foster a <strong>caring</strong>, <strong>collaborative</strong>,
and <strong>empowering</strong> school culture.</p>
<p>Our training is not just about skills—it is about <strong>developing the mindset</strong> and <strong>heartset</strong> of
leaders who serve others before self.</p>
<h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Application – Leading Through Action</strong></h3>
<p>Leadership at Naval Base Primary is rooted in <strong>authentic experience</strong>.
Students apply what they’ve learned through meaningful roles and real-world
projects, with timely feedback from teachers to help them grow.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Level 1 Leaders</strong>: Class Chairpersons
and Well-being Monitors create inclusive and positive classrooms.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Level 2 Leaders</strong>: Ambassadors
lead initiatives with school-wide impact, such as <em>Project Recycle</em> and <em>The Singa Project</em>,
inspiring care for the environment and community.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Level 3 Leaders</strong>: Prefects lead
daily duties with pride, maintain a safe and orderly school, and drive
impactful projects such as <strong>Service-Learning Food Donation Drives</strong> and <strong>Teachers’ Day celebrations</strong>,
leading by example to uplift others.</p>
<h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Evaluation – Reflecting, Refining, Rising</strong></h3>
<p>To guide each child’s growth, our student leaders engage in <strong>biannual self and peer evaluations</strong>,
as well as yearly feedback from their teachers. This reflection process
allows them to recognise their strengths, understand their development
areas, and celebrate progress.</p>
<p>We believe that leadership is a journey of continuous learning—and we
are committed to walking that journey with every child.</p>
<p>At Naval Base Primary, student leadership is not a title. It is a call
to serve, a journey of self-discovery, and a path to becoming future-ready
leaders of character. Together, we <strong>care deeply</strong>, <strong>collaborate meaningfully</strong>,
and <strong>empower confidently</strong>—because leadership begins with
the heart.</p>
