<h2>Student Leadership</h2>
<h5>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h5>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) has always been at the heart
of education in Singapore. It is central to the 21st Century Competencies
Framework and emphasizes the interconnectedness of the core values, social
and emotional competencies and civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural
skills that are critical for character and citizenship development of our
students.</p>

<p>CCE has always been at the heart of education in Naval Base Primary School.
The school vision which comprises of the CCE Outcomes is at the core of
our Character and Citizenship Development Framework. It anchors what we
seek to achieve in our students at the end of their 6 years in NBPS. The
CCE Outcomes are rooted in our School Values. NBPS has adopted a student-centric
approach in ensuring our students are well-supported socially, emotionally
and morally throughout their 6-year stay in school through the infusion
of SEL and 21st CC Skills. NBPS has a team of teachers, counsellors and
allied educators dedicated to develop and implement both instructional
and co-curricular programmes to provide for the holistic development of
our students.</p>

areas:</p>
<p>- At Home</p>
<p>- In School</p>
<p>- In the Community</p>
<p>Parents can involve their children in some simple tasks to teach their
children on how to take care of their shared spaces, so as to develop a
sense of responsibility beyond the classroom.&nbsp;</p>
