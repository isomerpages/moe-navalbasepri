## Programme for Active Learning (PAL)

In PAL, lower primary Navalites experience fun and varied activities related to the domains of Outdoor Education, Visual Arts, Performing Arts, and Sports & Games. It offers a balance between the academic and non-academic areas in the school, and facilitates holistic and well-rounded development of the pupils. Students learn socio-emotional competencies such as self and social awareness, self and relationship management and responsible decision making.

In PAL, emphasis is placed on experiential learning. The hands-on physical and aesthetics experiences allows students to explore, discover, think critically and express their ideas. All activities are designed to incorporate both individual and team work, at a level that is manageable for our Primary 1 and 2 pupils. Students will be able to reflect on their experiences as they have fun and enjoy themselves.
