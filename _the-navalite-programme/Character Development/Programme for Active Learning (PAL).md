<h2>Programme for Active Learning (PAL)</h2>
<p>In PAL, lower primary Navalites engage in fun and varied activities across
the domains of Outdoor Education, Visual Arts, Performing Arts, and Sports
&amp; Games. The programme provides a balance between academic and non-academic
learning, supporting the holistic development of our pupils. Through these
experiences, students develop socio-emotional competencies such as self-awareness,
social awareness, self-management, relationship management, and responsible
decision-making.</p>
<p>PAL places a strong emphasis on experiential learning. The hands-on experiences
in both the physical and aesthetic domains encourage students to explore,
discover, think critically, and express their ideas. All activities are
designed to include both individual and team-based tasks, tailored to suit
the developmental needs of our Primary 1 and 2 pupils. As they learn through
play and active participation, students are also given opportunities to
reflect on their experiences in a meaningful and enjoyable way.</p>
