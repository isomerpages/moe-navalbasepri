## CCE

#### OUR APPROACH

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is at the heart of education in Singapore. Through CCE, students learn values, social-emotional competencies, and develop character and citizenship dispositions that enable them to grow holistically and learn for life. To help our students adapt to disruptions in a rapidly evolving world, the knowledge, skills, and values taught in CCE need to remain current and relevant. CCE 2021 has been developed with this in mind to help our students navigate the realities of their time.

With CCE 2021, we aim to develop in our students:

* Good Character
* Resilience and Social-Emotional Well-Being
* Future Readiness
* Active Citizenship

#### KEY PROGRAMMES

**1)** **Navalite Character Awards**

The awards are to recognise outstanding students who are exemplary in character and who can be role models to inspire others. Students will be given the following awards.

* **Navalite Award (1 per class, Termly)**
* **Best Navalite Award (1 per class, Yearly)**
* **Navalite Honour Award (1 per level, Yearly)**

**2) Values-In-Action (VIA)**

VIA is an integral part of our school curriculum. The objective of VIA is to nurture students to be socially responsible and to help them understand his/her role in enhancing the well-being of the community and the country.

Every student in NBPS has to contribute at least 10 hours each year to complete VIA activities. Students will participate actively and meaningfully in a wide range of activities planned by the school. The activities will provide experiential learning opportunities to develop.

Navalites are provided with opportunities to take part in other programmes to help groups in their community and live out the value of compassion. For example, in the event “NBPS Cares”, our Primary 5 and Primary 6 Navalites work with their classes to donate and collect food items for nearby needy families and senior citizens.



**3)** **National Education (NE)**

##### (A)NE Commemorative events <br>TOTAL DEFENCE DAY&nbsp;

TOGETHER, WE KEEP SINGAPORE STRONG - that is the key message we hope our Navalites will take away from this year's Total Defence Day commemoration.

Throughout the week, the students were exposed to the various ways in which they can contribute to total defence, no matter how big or small. Among the highlights of the event are a special Total Defence Day assembly, a sweet potato rationing exercise and a visit from the Singapore Red Cross and the Singapore Police Force!

##### INTERNATIONAL FRIENDSHIP DAY

&nbsp;  
With an array of in-class activities during Assembly, CCE, English and Social Studies lessons, NBPS strives to ensure that by commemorating International Friendship Day, we can achieve our goals of:

* Being acquainted with the diverse and colourful culture and traditions of the region and the lives of the other ASEAN countries.
* Nurture the spirit of friendship and collaboration among different peoples in ASEAN and beyond.
* Having confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead.
* Keeping an open mindset, and express an appreciation of the contributions of foreigners living, working and studying in Singapore.

As the Little Red Dot, Singapore realises the importance of forging strong solidarity and friendship with her neighbouring countries in order to survive. This idea is instilled in students through the International Friendship Day commemorated every year in Term 2. The theme for IFD this year is “Singapore In The World”. COVID-19 brought challenges and opportunities for Singapore. The changing global landscapes highlighted the importance of maintaining good relationships and the need to recognise the importance of connectedness within and beyond ASEAN.

On 12 April, our school commemorated IFD with the opening of the Heritage Corner.

The Heritage Corner will serve as a Learning Centre for the teaching and learning of Social Studies.

IFD also provided students the opportunity to explore Singapore’s connection to the region and the world (Myanmar, Bhutan and New Zealand). Conducted through Zoom, the student emcees immersed the audience with the beautiful scenery of the country while at the same time, sharing unique facts about the country.

After a whole year of hiatus, our school CCA dancers showcased their energy and talent through their dance moves. The song that they danced to has helped many to feel positive. They have lighted it up like Dynamite!


##### RACIAL HARMONY DAY&nbsp;

Singapore: Our Multicultural Mosaic

What is your favourite local food? Navalites celebrated Racial Harmony Day 2022 by visiting the Heritage Corner in school to learn about the traditional techniques of making some of our local delights.
