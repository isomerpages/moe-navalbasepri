### VALUES-IN-ACTION
  

The Values-in-Action (VIA) is an integral part of our school curriculum. The objective of VIA is to nurture students to be socially responsible and to help them understand his/her role in enhancing the well-being of the community and the country.


Every student in NBPS has to contribute at least 10 hours each year to complete VIA activities. Students will participate actively and meaningfully in a wide range of activities planned by the school. The activities will provide experiential learning opportunities to develop character competence and commitment.

**<u>NBPS VIA Framework</u>**

### VIA

**P2: Doing My Part At Home**

As part of VIA, our P2 students demonstrate what it means to be responsible, starting from their homes as they help out with the simple household chores.

**P5 & P6 VIA：NBPS Cares Project**  

As part of their Values in Action (VIA) project, NBPS Cares, our Primary 5 and 6 Navalites donated food items and packed them into hampers ahead of the festive season to bring some good cheer to the nearby residents for Chinese New Year! With the help from Nee Soon South Zone H RC, these hampers were distributed to residents staying in the HDB flats opposite our school. Through this activity, our students are certainly living up to our school value of ‘Compassion, our Spirit’! Good job, Navalites!

#### TOTAL DEFENCE DAY 2021  

In commemoration of Total Defence Day on the 15th of February, our teachers dressed up smartly in their uniforms and led the school in the National Anthem, pledge and school song. Our student emcees sounded amazing via Zoom too!

#### INTERNATIONAL FRIENDSHIP DAY 2021  

With an array of in-class activities during Assembly, CCE, English and Social Studies lessons, NBPS strives to ensure that by commemorating International Friendship Day, we can achieve our goals of:  

*   Being acquainted with the diverse and colourful culture and traditions of the region and the lives of the other ASEAN countries.
*   Nurture the spirit of friendship and collaboration among different peoples in ASEAN and beyond.
*   Having confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead.
*   Keeping an open mindset, and express an appreciation of the contributions of foreigners living, working and studying in Singapore.

As the Little Red Dot, Singapore realises the importance of forging strong solidarity and friendship with her neighbouring countries in order to survive. This idea is instilled in students through the International Friendship Day commemorated every year in Term 2. The theme for IFD this year is Singapore In The World. COVID-19 brought challenges and opportunities for Singapore. The changing global landscapes highlighted the importance of maintaining good relationships and the need to recognise the importance of connectedness within and beyond ASEAN.

On 12 April, our school commemorated IFD with the opening of the Heritage Corner.
