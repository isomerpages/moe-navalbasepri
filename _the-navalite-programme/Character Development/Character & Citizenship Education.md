<h2>CCE</h2>
<h4>OUR APPROACH</h4>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is at the heart of education
in Singapore. Through CCE, students learn values, social-emotional competencies,
and develop character and citizenship dispositions that enable them to
grow holistically and learn for life. To help our students adapt to disruptions
in a rapidly evolving world, the knowledge, skills, and values taught in
CCE need to remain current and relevant. CCE 2021 has been developed with
this in mind to help our students navigate the realities of their time.</p>
<p>With CCE 2021, we aim to develop in our students:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Good Character</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resilience and Social-Emotional Well-Being</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Future Readiness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active Citizenship</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>KEY PROGRAMMES</h4>
<p><strong>1)</strong>  <strong>Navalite Character Awards</strong>
</p>
<p>The awards are to recognise outstanding students who are exemplary in
character and who can be role models to inspire others. Students will be
given the following awards.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Navalite Award (1 per class, Termly)</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Best Navalite Award (1 per class, Yearly)</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Navalite Honour Award (1 per level, Yearly)</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2) Values-In-Action (VIA)</strong>
</p>
<p>VIA is an integral part of our school curriculum. It aims to nurture students
to be socially responsible and to help them understand his/her role in
enhancing the well-being of the community and the country.</p>
<p>Our VIA structure is developmental. As students gain more experience,
they are given greater involvement and autonomy in planning their VIA projects.
Students’ involvement in VIA includes contributing to their family, school,
environment, as well as serving the Yishun community.</p>
<p>The VIA process is guided by the Design Thinking framework. Students begin
by empathising to understand the needs of others. They then define clear
goals, ideate by brainstorming, sharing ideas, and developing a plan. After
that, they carry out the tasks, and lastly, reflect on their VIA experience
to deepen their learning and growth.</p>

<h5>(A)NE Commemorative events <br>TOTAL DEFENCE DAY&nbsp;</h5>
<p>TOGETHER, WE KEEP SINGAPORE STRONG - that is the key message we hope our
Navalites will take away from this year's Total Defence Day commemoration.</p>
<p>Throughout the week, the students were exposed to the various ways in
which they can contribute to total defence, no matter how big or small.
Among the highlights of the event are a special Total Defence Day assembly,
a sweet potato rationing exercise and a visit from the Singapore Red Cross
and the Singapore Police Force!</p>
