### VALUES-IN-ACTION
  

The Values-in-Action (VIA) is an integral part of our school curriculum. The objective of VIA is to nurture students to be socially responsible and to help them understand his/her role in enhancing the well-being of the community and the country.


Every student in NBPS has to contribute at least 10 hours each year to complete VIA activities. Students will participate actively and meaningfully in a wide range of activities planned by the school. The activities will provide experiential learning opportunities to develop character competence and commitment.

**<u>NBPS VIA Framework</u>**

### VIA

**P2: Doing My Part At Home**

As part of VIA, our P2 students demonstrate what it means to be responsible, starting from their homes as they help out with the simple household chores.

**P5 & P6 VIA：NBPS Cares Project**  

As part of their Values in Action (VIA) project, NBPS Cares, our Primary 5 and 6 Navalites donated food items and packed them into hampers ahead of the festive season to bring some good cheer to the nearby residents for Chinese New Year! With the help from Nee Soon South Zone H RC, these hampers were distributed to residents staying in the HDB flats opposite our school. Through this activity, our students are certainly living up to our school value of ‘Compassion, our Spirit’! Good job, Navalites!

#### TOTAL DEFENCE DAY 2021  

In commemoration of Total Defence Day on the 15th of February, our teachers dressed up smartly in their uniforms and led the school in the National Anthem, pledge and school song. Our student emcees sounded amazing via Zoom too!

#### INTERNATIONAL FRIENDSHIP DAY 2021  

With an array of in-class activities during Assembly, CCE, English and Social Studies lessons, NBPS strives to ensure that by commemorating International Friendship Day, we can achieve our goals of:  

*   Being acquainted with the diverse and colourful culture and traditions of the region and the lives of the other ASEAN countries.
*   Nurture the spirit of friendship and collaboration among different peoples in ASEAN and beyond.
*   Having confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead.
*   Keeping an open mindset, and express an appreciation of the contributions of foreigners living, working and studying in Singapore.

As the Little Red Dot, Singapore realises the importance of forging strong solidarity and friendship with her neighbouring countries in order to survive. This idea is instilled in students through the International Friendship Day commemorated every year in Term 2. The theme for IFD this year is Singapore In The World. COVID-19 brought challenges and opportunities for Singapore. The changing global landscapes highlighted the importance of maintaining good relationships and the need to recognise the importance of connectedness within and beyond ASEAN.

On 12 April, our school commemorated IFD with the opening of the Heritage Corner.

The Heritage Corner will serve as a Learning Centre for the teaching and learning of Social Studies.

IFD also provided students the opportunity to explore Singapore’s connection to the region and the world (Myanmar, Bhutan and New Zealand). Conducted through Zoom, the student emcees immersed the audience with the beautiful scenery of the country while at the same time, sharing unique facts about the country.

After a whole year of hiatus, our school CCA dancers showcased their energy and talent through their dance moves. The song that they danced to has helped many to feel positive. They have lighted it up like Dynamite!

#### RACIAL HARMONY DAY 2021  

The theme for this year’s Racial Harmony Day commemoration is ‘Common Space, Connected Communities’.

   
Navalites were first engaged in a “This Week In History” presentation on the 1964 Race Riots reminding us how far we have come as a community in preserving racial and religious harmony.  
Subsequently, on 19 July, Navalites were treated to a Zoom Assembly programme led by our NESS ambassadors, titled “Four Weddings and a Connected Community”. Navalites learnt about the common culture and traditions of the 4 main races in Singapore: Chinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasian.

  
In addition, Navalites also learnt about traditional games and how to be a good neighbour via SLS and videos were also screened in the canteen during recess. They also enjoyed dressing up in various traditional costumes as can be seen in these pictures!

##### NATIONAL DAY CELEBRATIONS 2021: "TOGETHER, OUR SINGAPORE SPIRIT"  

In celebration of Singapore’s independence, Navalites were engaged in a school-wide celebration over Zoom. Students were encouraged to dress up as frontline workers to pay tribute to their contributions to Singapore. The solemn observance ceremony was followed by a two-part celebration based on the theme for NDP 2021 “Together, Our Singapore Spirit”.

“Part I: Together” saw Navalites enjoying this year’s National Day Parade theme song “The Road Ahead” and reflecting about our history and culture after watching a skit “Ramanujan & the Mixed-up Washing”.

“Part II: Our Singapore Spirit” opened with a video, “National Day Through the Years”. Our Navalites were excited to hear their Principal, Vice-Principals and teachers’ recollection of past National Days and learnt how Singapore has continued to progress and overcome all odds. The celebrations ended off on a high note with Navalites playing table rhythms and dancing to National Day songs, and watching their friends’ recorded performances.

Despite the constraints we have during this pandemic, our Singapore Spirit keeps us going to be resilient, determined and creative to reinvent the way we celebrate our nation’s independence.
