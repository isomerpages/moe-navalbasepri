## CCE

#### OUR APPROACH

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is at the heart of education in Singapore. Through CCE, students learn values, social-emotional competencies, and develop character and citizenship dispositions that enable them to grow holistically and learn for life. To help our students adapt to disruptions in a rapidly evolving world, the knowledge, skills, and values taught in CCE need to remain current and relevant. CCE 2021 has been developed with this in mind to help our students navigate the realities of their time.

With CCE 2021, we aim to develop in our students:

* Good Character
* Resilience and Social-Emotional Well-Being
* Future Readiness
* Active Citizenship

#### KEY PROGRAMMES

**1)** **Navalite Character Awards**

The awards are to recognise outstanding students who are exemplary in character and who can be role models to inspire others. Students will be given the following awards.

* **Navalite Award (1 per class, Termly)**
* **Best Navalite Award (1 per class, Yearly)**
* **Navalite Honour Award (1 per level, Yearly)**

**2) Values-In-Action (VIA)**

VIA is an integral part of our school curriculum. The objective of VIA is to nurture students to be socially responsible and to help them understand his/her role in enhancing the well-being of the community and the country.

Every student in NBPS has to contribute at least 10 hours each year to complete VIA activities. Students will participate actively and meaningfully in a wide range of activities planned by the school. The activities will provide experiential learning opportunities to develop.
